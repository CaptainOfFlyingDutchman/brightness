the file named "brightness" is an executable script file.

just copy the file to your /usr/local/bin directory. 

You need to be root to do so.

issue the command as follows in the directory where brightness is residing for now.

sudo cp brightness /usr/local/bin



usage:
*********
on the terminal type: brightness <any integer value between 0.3 to 1.0>

note:
********
this script might not work for multiple displays, as i've not tested it for such case. 
but it is working fine on single display machine.
